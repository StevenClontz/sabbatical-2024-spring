<p>Additionally, Clontz will collaborate with the steering committees of two major mathematics conferences, the Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference and the Summer Conference on Topology and its Applications, to begin development of a replacement to the now-defunct Topology Atlas platform. While some features of the Atlas (such as forums for posing and answering questions on mathematical research) are well-replicated by existing solutions (such as MathOverflow), there remains no elegant solution for handling abstract submissions and scheduling, so Clontz's work will focus on that vacuum. Some of this functionality has been roughly imitated through the use of Google Apps; it's anticipated that these can be wired together by designing new Javascript programs that recreate the automated workflows previously provided by the Atlas.</p>
