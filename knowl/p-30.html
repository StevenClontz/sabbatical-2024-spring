<p>In summary, sabbatical leave will provide Clontz support in the development of multiple software packages in support of mathematics research and instruction, enhancement of the technological and human infrastructure surrounding these products, the preparation of several NSF proposals, and continued success in mathematics research related to general and set-theoretic topology. Additionally, collaboration with the American Institute of Mathematics, which hosts over twenty workshops involving hundreds of mathematicians annually, will provide Clontz with networking opportunities that will further his career and bring positive exposure to the University.</p>
