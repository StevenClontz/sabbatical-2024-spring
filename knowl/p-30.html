<p>The other is Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-reu.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 24: Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)">[24]</a>. In particular, the research data used as the basis for the pi-Base was originally developed as part of an NSF-funded REU <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-steen.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 15: The Idea Man: An Interview with Lynn Steen">[15]</a>, which resulted in the reference text <span class="booktitle">Counterexamples in Topology</span>. In this spirit, a new REU program would allow students to extend this work using the pi-Base, expanding its coverage of the literature and making the platform more useful by researchers. Additionally, unlike some traditional mathematics REUs, students would gain knowledge of the cyberinfrastructure powering the pi-Base platform, and relevants skills that would extend to careers across STEM. This proposal is anticipated to be submitted in July 2022; sabbatical leave in Fall 2022 would free Clontz's time from usual sememster preparations to invest in this proposal.</p>
