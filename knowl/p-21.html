<p>The activities proposed involve the development of several software packages, preparation of grant proposals, traditional mathematics research, and more. Given the rapid development of such technologies and research, and the length of time between this application and the start of the sabbatical, it's difficult to pinpoint the precise work that will best fit a Fall 2022 or Spring 2023 semester leave. Therefore, this section describes a wide range of activities to be undertaken between now and the end of the 2022-23 academic year, assuming one semester of sabbatical.</p>
