<p>The American Institute of Mathematics (AIM) located in San Jose, California will serve as host for this sabbatical, connecting Clontz with other likeminded scholars engaged in the work of developing cyberinfrastructure for mathematics research and education. To support these activities, AIM has offered Clontz office space for the duration of the sabbatical, as well as funding to cover travel to San Jose and local expenses. Most of the collaborative work planned is alternatively able to be done virtually as needed via AIM's online collaboration platform developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, so sabbatical activities may be performed independent of public health concerns related to travel.</p>
