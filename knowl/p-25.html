<p>Throughout 2023, Clontz will be working on the development of an Open Source Ecosystem for PreTeXt software products used to develop Open Educational Resources for STEM higher education classrooms. In particular, Clontz's NSF-funded teaching release in Fall 2023 will allow him to hold virtual office hours for community members, iterate on security infrastructure for PreTeXt products, and develop a Software-as-a-Service solution for authoring, building, and deploying PreTeXT documents in the cloud. A $1.5M Phase II proposal will be submitted to the NSF around October 2023; sabbatical release in Spring 2024 will facilitate the continued development of this Open-Source Ecosystem while this proposal is under review.</p>
