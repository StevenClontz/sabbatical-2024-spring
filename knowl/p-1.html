<p>NSF's Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) “supports and coordinates the development, acquisition, and provision of state-of-the-art cyberinfrastructure resources, tools and services essential to the advancement and transformation of science and engineering”, and the NSF has doubled-down on this commitment with the recent establishment of its “Technology, Innovation and Partnerships” directorate, the first new NSF directorate in over 30 years. In service of this mission, Dr. Clontz serves as co-PI on NSF DUE Award 2011807, responsible for the development of several technologies to support evidence-based pedagogies in undergraduate mathematics education, and his NSF Proposal 2230153 as PI to develop an Open-Source Ecosystem fostering technologies used in the development of STEM higher-education Open Educational Resources has been recommended for funding beginning in 2023.</p>
