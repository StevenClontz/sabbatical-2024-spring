<p>Likewise, the authors of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-calcplot3d.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 24: Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge for Meaningful Learning and Instrumental Orchestrations: A Case Study of a Cross Product Exploration Using CalcPlot3D.">[24]</a> observed the limitations of educational software that technically works, but isn't designed for platforms that are readily in the hands of students and instructors. For example, while CalcPlot3D has always been free and open-source software, it was originally limited in its reach due to being written in Java. By rewriting the application in (the similarly-named but unrelated programming language) Javascript, students and instructors were no longer required to be at a computer station with a Java runtime installed, but could instead utilize the program from any device with a web browser.</p>
