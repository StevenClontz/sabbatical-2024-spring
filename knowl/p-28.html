<p>The work described above is well-aligned with two specific NSF solicistations. The first is Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Education and Human Resources <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-iuse.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 19: Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Education and Human Resources (IUSE: EHR)">[19]</a>. Clontz is currently funded as part of an IUSE program on Team-Based Inquiry Learning, and served as a consultant for another IUSE program studying the use of open-source textbooks in undergraduate mathematics education, particularly those authored in PreTeXt. In January 2022, Clontz will submit a new IUSE proposal focusing on the cyberinfrastructure needs of these projects and related RUME work. If this grant is not funded, sabbatical leave would be very useful to revise and resubmit in Spring 2023, based upon reviews from the NSF.</p>
