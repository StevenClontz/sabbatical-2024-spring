<p>This proposal requests to leverage the momentum from these projects by allowing Clontz to spend Spring 2024 collaborating with scholars across the country in the development of advanced free-and-open-source (FOSS) cyberinfrastructure for mathematics research and STEM higher education. The American Institute of Mathematics will serve as Clontz's host for this sabbatical leave. The deliverables of this sabbatical will include multiple software products benefiting mathematics research and STEM higher education, enhancement of the human infrastructure surrounding these products, and the continued development of Clontz's ongoing research in general topology.</p>
