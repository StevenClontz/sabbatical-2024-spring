<p>An alpha version of the Scratchee app for creating and sharing virtualized scratch cards for IF-AT was released in late July 2021. This prototype was created in response to developments related to Clontz's NSF grant for supporting Team-Based Inquiry Learning; while physical IF-AT cards are not incredibly expensive, they introduce logistical friction for implementing TBIL (ordering the cards, waiting for shipment, aligning multiple-choice questions with the predetermined correct responses printed on the card). Multiple TBIL instructors are using Scratchee in Fall 2021; their experiences will be used to determine the necessary enhancements required for a public release of the platform for the broader Team-Based Learning community.</p>
