<p>Sabbatical leave from instruction is requested to facilitate progress on the above activities while allowing Clontz to continue his active line of traditional mathematics research on the game-theoretic characterization of topological properties. Briefly, a <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">topological space</dfn> models data points along with neighborhoods that describe nearby data; for example, the Euclidean line uses real numbers \(x\in\mathbb R\) as points, and intervals \((x-r,x+r)\) of radius \(r&gt;0\) as neighborhoods. At the time of writing, Clontz is investigating how to characterize topological dimension (as simple examples, a square is two-dimensional and a cube is three-dimensional) in terms of which player in a certain game defined for each topological space has a winning strategy. Recent results by Babinkostova and Scheepers published in the Proceedings of the Americian Mathematical Society have established three such games <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-scheepers.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 3: Countable dimensionality, a game and the Haver property">[3]</a>; however, these results are only guaranteed when a <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">metric</dfn> measuring distance between points as non-negative real numbers is known to exist (for example, \(|x-y|\) is the distance from \(x\) to \(y\) on the Euclidean line of real numbers). When such a measurement is not guaranteed, the two common definitions of dimension no longer are equivalent, making the study of non-metrizable spaces difficult. This also illustrates the utility of a more robust pi-Base, as finding literature on dimension in the context of non-metrizable spaces is very difficult when only using search engines and chasing citations, so this work will also be incorporated into the pi-Base as it is completed to assist future scholars.</p>
