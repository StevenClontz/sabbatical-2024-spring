<p>One approach to overcoming this limitation is the development of databases of mathematical objects. As of writing, the <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="booktitle">Catalogue of Mathematical Datasets</span> <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-mathdb.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 6: Catalogue of Mathematical Datasets">[6]</a> enumerates \(83\) such tools. One of these is the <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="booktitle">\(\pi\)-Base</span> (a.k.a. pi-Base) community database of topological counterexamples <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-pibase.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 12: \(\pi\)-Base">[12]</a>, created by software engineer James Dabbs. Clontz joined the project in 2017 to serve as its lead mathematical editor. In the beginning the database was treated similar to a wiki, with unreviewed contributions made by several mathematicians, students, and other unknown contributors. To address this, changes were made to the software to enforce a level of peer review, and Clontz was awarded with an internal Faculty Development Council grant to hire a student to audit and expand the content of the database.</p>
