<p>This proposal aims to leverage the momentum from these projects by allowing Clontz to spend one semester during the 2022-23 academic year collaborating with scholars across the country in the development of advanced free-and-open-source (FOSS) cyberinfrastructure for mathematics research and undergraduate mathematics education. The <a class="external" href="https://aimath.org" target="_blank">American Institute of Mathematics</a> will serve as Clontz's host for this sabbatical leave, and his collaborators will include steering committee chairs of two major topology research conferences, as well as a professional software engineer with a background in topology. In addition to software deliverables that will enhance mathematics research and education, this leave will be used to develop proposals for additional external funding from the National Science Foundation, produce traditional academic research in topology to be presented at conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals, and network with statewide magnet STEM high schools to promote the University to high-performing students.</p>
