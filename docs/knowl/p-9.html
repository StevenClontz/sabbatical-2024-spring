<p>Another key element of cyberinfrastructure in mathematics research is the tooling used for creating both collaborative spaces and venues for dissemination, both virtually and in-person. Of course, recent events have exposed the utility of virtual collaborations, and tools such as Zoom and Sococo have done well to meet this need both for small meetings and large conferences. But organization of large conferences, whether in-person or otherwise, is not easily done without the use of technology. Historically, the <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="booktitle">Topology Atlas</span> <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-atlas.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 7: Topology Atlas">[7]</a> met this need, not just in topology but in many other areas of mathematics as well, but this abstract and conference scheduling platform was ended in 2020 following twenty-five years in service. Its shuttering has left a void that creates inefficiencies for researchers, distracting from their core work.</p>
