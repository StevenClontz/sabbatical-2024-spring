<p>Clontz is also heavily involved in mathematics outreach. He serves as director of Mathematical Puzzle Programs, which organizes fun escape-room-like experiences for the general public at nine college campuses across the country, whose puzzles incorporate contemporary mathematics research. Likewise, Clontz previously consulted with the new Alabama School of Cyber Technology and Engineering (ASCTE) statewide magnet high school in Huntsville to develop their technology-integrated freshman mathematics curriculum, and often collaborates with the Alabama School of Mathematics and Science (ASMS) statewide magnet high school local to Mobile as well. Sabbatical leave will give Clontz increased flexibility to support MaPP activities across the country, as well as visit ASCTE and ASMS to provide support integrating modern technologies into their mathematics curricula and promote the University to their talented students.</p>
