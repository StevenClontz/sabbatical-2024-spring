<p>But perhaps underrated are the systems used by mathematicians for sharing and collaborating bleeding-edge advancements with the community of research. The mathematics written on paper or the chalkboard cannot travel far on its own; generally, mathematicians use software such as LaTeX to typeset proofs and formulas for distribution in PDF format. Then, rather than asking colleagues from across the country to physically visit their office computer, the researcher uses technologies such as email, a personal website, and/or a preprint server to post their work for dissemination. High-quality work must then be submitted to a journal to be vetted by peers, a process handled sometimes through email, and other times via non-trivial content management systems hosted in the cloud. These results are then published, but this content is now burned into inaccessible (in many senses of the word) PDFs locked behind paywalls. A typical strategy for finding recent developments in mathematics is to Google key words, but a search for “selection games”, an area of mathematical game theory studied by the applicant, quickly reveals the limitations of this approach.</p>
