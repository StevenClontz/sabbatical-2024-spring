<p>In summary, sabbatical leave will provide Clontz support in the development of five FOSS software packages in support of mathematics research and instruction, the preparation of several NSF proposals, and continued success in mathematics research and outreach. Additionally, collaborations with the American Institute of Mathematics, which hosts over twenty workshops involving hundreds of mathematicians annually, and the steering comittes of two major mathematics conferences, also involving hundreds of mathematicians, will provide Clontz with networking opportunities that will further his career and bring positive exposure to the University.</p>
