<p>A current shortcoming of the pi-Base application is lack of tooling to preview work on the actual web application (or a facsimile thereof) by both contributors and referees. Instead, numerical IDs for each object in the database must be manually looked up and compared across several files, and this process allows plenty of room for human error. The main development goal for the pi-Base is to add functionality via GitHub Actions that will automatically provide an online preview of how individual contributions will change the overall database, which can be used by both contributors and referees to catch such mistakes before they are published to the public. Such features will also assist new contributors in making improvements by providing a more graphical user interface compared to the current editing of text files.</p>
