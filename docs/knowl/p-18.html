<p>But for the purposes of this project, “free” also implies that the software, whenever possible, will be developed mindfully to avoid dependencies on non-free infrastructures. For example, technically the Canvas Learning Management System is FOSS software <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-canvas.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 10: Canvas LMS on GitHub">[10]</a>; however, that does not mean that it can truly be adopted without cost. Maintainance of a learning management system server incurs both technology costs and personhour costs, which is why many campuses, including the University, simply pay Instructure to provide the service rather than utilize its FOSS directly. Technical debt can never be completely avoided; however, by making smart design decisions in the development of software packages that aren't intended to turn a profit, this debt can be kept minimal. To this end, most of the software produced will either be written in HTML/Javascript, which can be freely hosted and run in any modern web browser, or will produce static such HTML/JS products for dissemination.</p>
