<p>After preliminary development for two years for Clontz's personal use, the CheckIt Platform received its first public release in June 2021. Two dozen instructors participated in an introductory authoring workshop, and as of August 2021 randomized exercise banks have be published or are in development for calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, introductory statistics, quantitative reasoning, and mathematics for liberal arts courses, many of which will be used to facilitate Fall 2021 instruction. This quick evidence of productivity witnesses the utility of the platform, and it has also generated many requests for new features and bugfixes.</p>
