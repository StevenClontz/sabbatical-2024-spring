<p>The American Institute of Mathematics located in San Jose, California will serve as host for this sabbatical, connecting Clontz with other likeminded scholars engaged in the work of developing cyberinfrastructure for mathematics research and education. Current university guidance notes the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19 during travel. As such, while it is expected that some of the activities described will be performed in-person, all of the work is able to be done virtually via AIM's online Sococo workspace used regularly by dozens of mathematicians working on OER textbooks and technologies. Any necessary travel will be covered by either collaborators' grants or the applicant's current NSF funding; in addition, further funding will be requested in an upcoming NSF proposal focused specifically on cyberinfrastructure develoment (see below).</p>
