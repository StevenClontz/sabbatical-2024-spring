<p>The American Institute of Mathematics (AIM) located in San Jose, California will serve as host for this sabbatical, connecting Clontz with other likeminded scholars engaged in the work of developing cyberinfrastructure for mathematics research and education. To support these activities, AIM has offered Clontz office space for the duration of the sabbatical, as well as funding to cover travel to San Jose and local expenses. However, current university guidance notes the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19 during travel. As such, while it is expected that some of the activities described will be performed in-person, most of the collaborative work planned is also able to be done virtually as needed via AIM's online collaboration platform developed during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
