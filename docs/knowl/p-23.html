<p>To begin to make these improvements, Clontz will meet with the pi-Base's lead developer James Dabbs for one week at the beginning of the sabbatical for a focused development sprint. During this visit, Clontz will give a talk to a Javascript development organization Dabbs belongs to on the use of Javascript programming in academia. Note that the pi-Base is developed using the same technologies (particularly, the Svelte Javascript framework) as Clontz's CheckIt and Scratchee projects, and is used by Dabbs in his daily work as a software engineer. As such, this meeting will have cascading effects across the rest of the work performed throughout the sabbatical, by providing time and support for Clontz to pick up more advanced Javascript programming techniques fueled by best industry practices. In addition, this training will enable Clontz to serve not only as the pi-Base's lead mathematical editor, but also as a co-developer of the platform itself, ensuring that an academic researcher is capable of maintaining the platform in case of future technical issues.</p>
