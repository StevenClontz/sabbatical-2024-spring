<p>Partially supported by NSF DUE 2011807, Clontz has developed two software applications to support mathematics instruction and Team-Based Learning, the focus of the University's most recent Quality Enhancement Project. The first is the <a class="external" href="https://checkit.clontz.org" target="_blank">CheckIt Platform</a>, allowing instructors to write minimal code to generate randomized mathematics exercises that can be automatically exported not only to LaTeX/PDF for printing, but also published to the web as practice exercises, and to LMSes including Canvas, D2L, and Moodle. The second is <a class="external" href="https://scratchee.clontz.org" target="_blank">Scratchee</a>, a virtualization of the Instant Feedback Assessment Technique (IF-AT) <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-ifat.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 13: Rapid feedback assessment methods: Can we improve engagement and preparation for exams in large-enrollment courses?">[13]</a> integral to Team-Based Learning. In addition, Clontz serves as collaborator on the <a class="external" href="https://pretextbook.org" target="_blank">PreTeXt</a> project, developing a user-friendly platform for authoring the PreTeXt markup XML language that produces both PDF and accessible HTML textbooks and research manuscripts from the same source. Critically, these software applications are developed to be used completely within a web browser on nearly any device, without any need for downloads or installations.</p>
