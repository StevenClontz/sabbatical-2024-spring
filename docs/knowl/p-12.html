<p>Partially supported by NSF DUE 2011807, Clontz has developed two software applications to support mathematics instruction and Team-Based Inquiry Learning (TBIL), a flavor of Team-Based Learning that was the focus of the University's most recent Quality Enhancement Project. The first is the <a class="external" href="https://checkit.clontz.org" target="_blank">CheckIt Platform</a>, allowing instructors to write minimal code to generate randomized mathematics exercises that can be automatically exported not only to LaTeX/PDF for printing, but also published to the web as practice exercises, and to LMSes including Canvas, D2L, and Moodle. The second is <a class="external" href="https://scratchee.clontz.org" target="_blank">Scratchee</a>, a virtualization of the Instant Feedback Assessment Technique (IF-AT) <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-ifat.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 15: Rapid feedback assessment methods: Can we improve engagement and preparation for exams in large-enrollment courses?">[15]</a> integral to TBIL. In addition, Clontz serves as collaborator on the <a class="external" href="https://pretextbook.org" target="_blank">PreTeXt</a> project, developing a user-friendly platform for authoring the PreTeXt markup language that produces both PDF and accessible HTML documents (including textbooks and research manuscripts) from the same source, including this proposal <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-repo.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 12: StevenClontz/sabbatical-proposal-2022">[12]</a>. Furthermore, docuemnts authored in PreTeXt can also be automatically published as Braille <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-braille.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 11: Math that feels good: Creating learning resources for blind students">[11]</a>, an uncommon feature for commercial textbooks, much less free Open Educational Resources (OER), providing access to mathematics often out of reach to blind students.</p>
