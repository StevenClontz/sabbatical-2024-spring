<section class="introduction" id="introduction-2"><p id="p-19">Sabbatical leave is requested for either Fall 2022 or Spring 2023. While Fall 2022 is preferred, and further delay of these proposed activities will lessen their broader impact, the applicant recognizes the need for flexibility in reallocating duties to the department. Either way, it's anticipated that these activities will extend into the adjacent summer semester, modulo Clontz's obligations to ongoing grant activity.</p>
<p id="p-20">The American Institute of Mathematics (AIM) located in San Jose, California will serve as host for this sabbatical, connecting Clontz with other likeminded scholars engaged in the work of developing cyberinfrastructure for mathematics research and education. Current university guidance notes the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19 during travel. As such, while it is expected that some of the activities described will be performed in-person, all of the collaborative work planned is able to be done virtually via AIM's online Sococo workspace. Any necessary travel will be covered by either collaborators' grants or the applicant's current NSF funding; in addition, further funding will be requested in an upcoming NSF proposal focused specifically on cyberinfrastructure develoment (see below).</p>
<p id="p-21">The activities proposed involve the development of several software packages, preparation of grant proposals, traditional mathematics research, and more. Given the rapid development of such technologies and research, and the length of time between this application and the start of the sabbatical, it's difficult to pinpoint the precise work that will best fit a Fall 2022 or Spring 2023 semester leave. Therefore, a wide range of activities that will benefit from sabbatical teaching release is described below.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-4"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

</h3>
<p id="p-22">A current shortcoming of the pi-Base application is lack of tooling to preview work on the actual web application (or a facsimile thereof) by both contributors and referees. Instead, numerical IDs for each object in the database must be manually looked up and compared across several files, and this process allows plenty of room for human error. The main development goal for the pi-Base is to add functionality via GitHub Actions that will automatically provide an online preview of how individual contributions will change the overall database, which can be used by both contributors and referees to catch such mistakes before they are published to the public. Such features will also assist new contributors in making improvements by providing a more graphical user interface compared to the current editing of text files.</p>
<p id="p-23">To begin to make these improvements, Clontz will meet with the pi-Base's lead developer James Dabbs for one week at the beginning of the sabbatical for a focused development sprint. During this visit, Clontz will give a talk to a Javascript development organization Dabbs belongs to on the use of Javascript programming in academia. Note that the pi-Base is developed using the same technologies (particularly, the Svelte Javascript framework) as Clontz's CheckIt and Scratchee projects, and is used by Dabbs in his daily work as a software engineer. As such, this meeting will have cascading effects across the rest of the work performed throughout the sabbatical, by providing time and support for Clontz to pick up more advanced Javascript programming techniques fueled by best industry practices. In addition, this training will enable Clontz to serve not only as the pi-Base's lead mathematical editor, but also as a co-developer of the platform itself, ensuring that an academic researcher is capable of maintaining the platform in case of future technical issues.</p>
<p id="p-24">Additionally, Clontz will collaborate with the steering committees of two major mathematics conferences, the Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference and the Summer Conference on Topology and its Applications, to begin development of a replacement to the now-defunct Topology Atlas platform. While some features of the Atlas (such as forums for posing and answering questions on mathematical research) are well-replicated by existing solutions (such as MathOverflow), there remains no elegant solution for handling abstract submissions and scheduling, so Clontz's work will focus on that vacuum. Some of this functionality has been roughly imitated through the use of Google Apps; it's anticipated that these can be wired together by designing new Javascript programs that recreate the automated workflows previously provided by the Atlas.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-5"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<p id="p-25">After preliminary development for two years for Clontz's personal use, the CheckIt Platform received its first public release in June 2021. Two dozen instructors participated in an introductory authoring workshop, and as of August 2021 randomized exercise banks have be published or are in development for calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, introductory statistics, quantitative reasoning, and mathematics for liberal arts courses, many of which will be used to facilitate Fall 2021 instruction. This quick evidence of productivity witnesses the utility of the platform, and it has also generated many requests for new features and bugfixes.</p>
<p id="p-26">An alpha version of the Scratchee app for creating and sharing virtualized scratch cards for IF-AT was released in late July 2021. This prototype was created in response to developments related to Clontz's NSF grant for supporting Team-Based Inquiry Learning; while physical IF-AT cards are not incredibly expensive, they introduce logistical friction for implementing TBIL (ordering the cards, waiting for shipment, aligning multiple-choice questions with the predetermined correct responses printed on the card). Multiple TBIL instructors are using Scratchee in Fall 2021; their experiences will be used to determine the necessary enhancements required for a public release of the platform for the broader Team-Based Learning community.</p>
<p id="p-27">Beginning in Summer 2020, Clontz partnered with Prof. Oscar Levin to develop PreTeXt-CLI, a command-line user interface for quickly generating PreTeXt template projects, authoring new materials, and publishing them to freely available internet hosts. AIM provided support for Clontz and Levin to continue this work in Summer 2021, and in August 2021 the PreTeXt-CLI became the canonical interface for authoring textbooks and research manuscripts in PreTeXt. The CLI is significantly simpler to install and use compared with previous tools; however, more work remains to integrate the tool with the VS Code graphical web application, with the ultimate goal of creating an elegant web browser-based authoring experience akin to using Google Docs or Overleaf, but producing documents accessible by both sighted and blind students. Additionally, there have been requests to directly integrate the CheckIt Platform into the PreTeXt ecosystem, allowing textbook authors to directly create randomized exercises for the end of each section.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-6"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
