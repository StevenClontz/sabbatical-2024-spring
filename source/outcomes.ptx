  <title>Summary of Anticipated Outcomes</title>
  <p>
In summary, sabbatical leave will provide Clontz support in the
development of multiple software packages in support of mathematics
research and instruction, enhancement of the technological and human
infrastructure surrounding these products, the preparation of several NSF proposals,
and continued success in mathematics research related to general and set-theoretic
topology. Additionally,
collaboration with the American Institute of Mathematics, which hosts
over twenty workshops involving hundreds of mathematicians annually,
will provide Clontz with
networking opportunities that will further his career and bring positive
exposure to the University.
