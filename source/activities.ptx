  <title>Proposed Activities</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
Sabbatical leave is requested for either Fall 2022 or Spring 2023. While
Fall 2022 is preferred, and further delay of these proposed activities will
lessen their broader impact, the applicant recognizes the need for flexibility
in reallocating duties to the department. Either way, it's anticipated that
these activities will extend into the adjacent summer semester, modulo Clontz's
obligations to ongoing grant activity.
    </p>
    <p>
The American Institute of Mathematics located in San Jose, California will serve
as host for this sabbatical, connecting Clontz with other likeminded scholars
engaged in the work of developing cyberinfrastructure for mathematics research
and education. Current university guidance notes the risk of catching or spreading
COVID-19 during travel. As such, while it is expected that some of the activities
described will be performed in-person, all of the work is able to be done virtually
via AIM's online Sococo workspace used regularly by dozens of mathematicians working on
OER textbooks and technologies. Any necessary travel will be covered by either
collaborators' grants or the applicant's current NSF funding; in addition, further
funding will be requested in an upcoming NSF proposal focused specifically on
cyberinfrastructure develoment (see below).

A current shortcoming of the pi-Base application is lack of tooling to preview
work on the actual web application (or a facsimile thereof) by both contributors
and referees. Instead, numerical IDs for each object in the database must be manually
looked up and compared across several files, and this process allows plenty of
room for human error. The main development goal for the pi-Base is to add functionality
via GitHub Actions that will automatically provide an online preview of how individual
contributions will change the overall database, which can be used by both contributors
and referees to catch such mistakes before they are published to the public. Such features
will also assist new contributors in making improvements by providing a more graphical
user interface compared to the current editing of text files.
    </p>
    <p>
To begin to make these improvements, Clontz will meet with the pi-Base's lead developer
James Dabbs for one week at the beginning of the sabbatical
for a focused development sprint. During this visit, Clontz will give a talk to
a Javascript development organization Dabbs belongs to on the use of Javascript programming
in academia. Note that the pi-Base is developed
using the same technologies (particularly, the Svelte Javascript framework) as
Clontz's CheckIt and Scratchee projects, and is used by Dabbs in his daily work as a 
software engineer. As such, this meeting will have cascading effects across the rest
of the work performed throughout the sabbatical, by providing time for Clontz to pick up
more advanced Javascript programming techniques fueled by best industry practices.
In addition, this training will enable Clontz to serve not only as the pi-Base's lead
mathematical editor, but also as a co-developer of the platform itself, ensuring that an
academic researcher is capable of maintaining the platform in case of future technical issues.
