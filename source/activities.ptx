  <title>Proposed Activities</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
Sabbatical leave is requested for Fall 2022. While further delay of these
proposed activities will
lessen their broader impact, the applicant recognizes the need for flexibility
in reallocating duties to the department, and thus Spring 2023 is also
acceptable if necessary. Either way, it's anticipated that
these activities will extend into the adjacent summer semester, modulo Clontz's
obligations to ongoing grant activity.
    </p>
    <p>
The American Institute of Mathematics (AIM) located in San Jose, California will serve
as host for this sabbatical, connecting Clontz with other likeminded scholars
engaged in the work of developing cyberinfrastructure for mathematics research
and education. To support these activities, AIM has offered Clontz office space
for the duration of the sabbatical, as well as funding to cover travel to San Jose and
local expenses. Most of the collaborative work planned 
is alternatively able to be done virtually as needed via AIM's online collaboration platform developed
during the COVID-19 pandemic, so sabbatical activities may be performed independent
of public health concerns related to travel.
    </p>
    <p>
The activities proposed involve the development of several software packages,
preparation of grant proposals, traditional mathematics research, and more. Given the rapid
development of such technologies and research, and the length of time between
this application and the start of the sabbatical, it's difficult to pinpoint the
precise work that will best fit a Fall 2022 or Spring 2023 semester leave. Therefore,
this section describes a wide range of activities to be undertaken between now and the
end of the 2022-23 academic year, assuming one semester of sabbatical.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>FOSS Cyberinfrastructure for Mathematics Research</title>
    <p>
A current shortcoming of the pi-Base application is lack of tooling to preview
work on the actual web application (or a facsimile thereof) by both contributors
and referees. Instead, numerical IDs for each object in the database must be manually
looked up and compared across several files, and this process allows plenty of
room for human error. The main development goal for the pi-Base is to add functionality
via GitHub Actions that will automatically provide an online preview of how individual
contributions will change the overall database, which can be used by both contributors
and referees to catch such mistakes before they are published to the public. Such features
will also assist new contributors in making improvements by providing a more graphical
user interface compared to the current editing of text files.
    </p>
    <p>
To begin to make these improvements, Clontz will meet with the pi-Base's lead developer
James Dabbs for one week at the beginning of the sabbatical
for a focused development sprint. During this visit, Clontz will give a talk to
a Javascript development organization Dabbs belongs to on the use of Javascript programming
in academia. Note that the pi-Base is developed
using the same technologies (particularly, the Svelte Javascript framework) as
Clontz's CheckIt and Scratchee projects, and is used by Dabbs in his daily work as a 
software engineer. As such, this meeting will have cascading effects across the rest
of the work performed throughout the sabbatical, by providing time and support for Clontz to pick
up more advanced Javascript programming techniques fueled by best industry practices.
In addition, this training will enable Clontz to serve not only as the pi-Base's lead
mathematical editor, but also as a co-developer of the platform itself, ensuring that an
academic researcher is capable of maintaining the platform in case of future technical issues.
    </p>
    <p>
Additionally, Clontz will collaborate with the steering committees of two major mathematics
conferences, the Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference and the Summer Conference on Topology
and its Applications, to begin development of a replacement to the now-defunct
Topology Atlas platform. While some features of the Atlas (such as forums for posing and
answering questions on mathematical research) are well-replicated by existing solutions
(such as MathOverflow), there remains no elegant solution for handling abstract submissions
and scheduling, so Clontz's work will focus on that vacuum.
Some of this functionality has been roughly imitated through the use of Google
Apps; it's anticipated that these can be wired together by designing new Javascript
programs that recreate the automated workflows previously provided by the Atlas. 
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>FOSS Cyberinfrastructure for Mathematics Instruction and RUME</title>
    <p>
After preliminary development for two years for Clontz's personal use, the CheckIt Platform
received its first public release in June 2021. Two dozen instructors participated
in an introductory authoring workshop, and as of August 2021 randomized exercise banks have
be published or are in development for calculus, linear algebra, differential equations,
introductory statistics, quantitative reasoning, and mathematics for liberal arts courses,
many of which will be used to facilitate Fall 2021 instruction.
This quick evidence of productivity witnesses the utility of the platform, and it has
also generated many requests for new features and bugfixes.
    </p>
    <p>
An alpha version of the Scratchee app for creating and sharing virtualized scratch cards
for IF-AT was released in late July 2021. This prototype was created in response to
developments related to Clontz's NSF grant for supporting Team-Based Inquiry Learning; while
physical IF-AT cards are not incredibly expensive, they introduce logistical friction for implementing
TBIL (ordering the cards, waiting for shipment, aligning multiple-choice questions with the
predetermined correct responses printed on the card). Multiple TBIL instructors are using
Scratchee in Fall 2021; their experiences will be used to determine the necessary enhancements
required for a public release of the platform for the broader Team-Based Learning community.
    </p>
    <p>
Beginning in Summer 2020, Clontz partnered with Prof. Oscar Levin to develop PreTeXt-CLI,
a command-line user interface for quickly generating PreTeXt template projects, authoring new materials,
and publishing them to freely available internet hosts. AIM provided support for Clontz and Levin to
continue this work in Summer 2021, and in August 2021 the PreTeXt-CLI became the canonical interface
for authoring textbooks and research manuscripts in PreTeXt. The CLI is significantly simpler to
install and use compared with previous tools; however, more work remains to integrate the tool
with the VS Code graphical web application, with the ultimate goal of creating
an elegant web browser-based authoring experience akin to using Google Docs or Overleaf, but
producing documents accessible by both sighted and blind students. Additionally, there have
been requests to directly integrate the CheckIt Platform into the PreTeXt ecosystem, allowing
textbook authors to directly create randomized exercises for the end of each section.

    <title>External Grant-Seeking</title>
    <p>
The work described above is well-aligned with two specific NSF solicistations. The first
is Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Education and Human Resources <xref ref="biblio-iuse"/>.
Clontz is currently
funded as part of an IUSE program on Team-Based Inquiry Learning, and served as a consultant
for another IUSE program studying the use of open-source textbooks in undergraduate mathematics
education,
particularly those authored in PreTeXt. In January 2022, Clontz will submit a new IUSE
proposal focusing on the cyberinfrastructure needs of these projects and related RUME work.
If this grant is not funded, sabbatical leave would be very useful to revise and resubmit in
Spring 2023, based upon reviews from the NSF.
    </p>
    <p>
The other is Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) <xref ref="biblio-reu"/>.
In particular, the research data used as the basis for the pi-Base was originally developed
as part of an NSF-funded REU <xref ref="biblio-steen"/>, which resulted in the reference text
<pubtitle>Counterexamples in Topology</pubtitle>. In this spirit, a new REU program would
allow students to extend this work using the pi-Base, expanding its coverage of the literature
and making the platform more useful by researchers. Additionally, unlike some traditional
mathematics REUs, students would gain knowledge of the cyberinfrastructure powering the
pi-Base platform, and relevants skills that would extend to careers across STEM.
This proposal is anticipated to be submitted in July 2022; sabbatical leave in Fall 2022 would
free Clontz's time from usual sememster preparations to invest in this proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
Clontz is also engaged with additional NSF grant-writing in association with the
Mathematical Puzzle Programs outreach organization, described below. He served as co-PI
for an Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) <xref ref="biblio-aisl"/> proposal
submitted in January 2021; while not funded, the proposal received promising reviews,
and a new proposal will be submitted in 2022.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Additional Activites</title>
    <p>
Sabbatical leave from instruction is requested to facilitate progress on the
above activities while allowing Clontz to continue his active line of traditional
mathematics research on the game-theoretic characterization of topological properties.
Briefly, a <term>topological space</term> models data points along with neighborhoods that describe
nearby data; for example, the Euclidean line uses real numbers <m>x\in\mathbb R</m>
as points, and intervals <m>(x-r,x+r)</m> of radius <m>r>0</m> as neighborhoods.
At the time of writing, Clontz is investigating how to characterize topological dimension
(as simple examples, a square is two-dimensional and a cube is three-dimensional) in terms of
which player in a certain game defined for each topological space has a winning strategy.
Recent results by Babinkostova and Scheepers published in the Proceedings of the
Americian Mathematical Society have established three such games
<xref ref="biblio-scheepers"/>; however, these results
are only guaranteed when a <term>metric</term> measuring distance between points as
non-negative real numbers is known to exist
(for example, <m>|x-y|</m> is the distance from <m>x</m> to <m>y</m>
on the Euclidean line of real numbers). When such a measurement is not guaranteed,
the two common definitions of dimension no longer are equivalent, making the study of
non-metrizable spaces difficult. This also illustrates the utility of a more robust
pi-Base, as finding literature on dimension in the context of non-metrizable spaces
is very difficult when only using search engines and chasing citations, so this work
will also be incorporated into the pi-Base as it is completed to assist future
scholars.
    </p>
    <p>
Clontz is also heavily involved in mathematics outreach. He serves as director of
Mathematical Puzzle Programs, which organizes fun escape-room-like experiences
for the general public at nine college campuses across the country,
whose puzzles incorporate contemporary mathematics research.
Likewise, Clontz previously consulted with the new Alabama School of Cyber Technology
and Engineering (ASCTE) statewide magnet high school in Huntsville to develop their
technology-integrated
freshman mathematics curriculum, and often collaborates with the
Alabama School of Mathematics and Science (ASMS) statewide
magnet high school local to Mobile as well. Sabbatical leave will give Clontz increased
flexibility to support MaPP activities across the country, as well as visit ASCTE and
ASMS to provide support integrating modern technologies into their mathematics curricula
and promote the University to their talented students.
