The term <term>cyberinfrastructure</term> traces its roots back to
Presidential Decision Directive NSC-63
<xref ref="biblio-prez"/>, and is commonly used today to refer to
<q>computational systems, data and
information management, advanced instruments, visualization
environments, and people, all linked together by software and
advanced networks to improve scholarly productivity and enable
knowledge breakthroughs and discoveries not otherwise possible</q>
<xref ref="biblio-cyber-educause"/>. What cyberinfrastructure <q>looks like</q>
varies greatly between disciplines, but a constant quality of it is
the utilization of modern technologies that make the jobs of scholars
more efficient, thereby producing more and better advancements in
STEM. As such, the National Science Foundation <xref ref="biblio-cyber-nsf"/> 
and other federal agencies
have made the development of cyberinfrastructure a key priority in
supporting STEM scholarship as noted below
(emphasis added):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>
NSF invests in powerful cyberinfrastructure that enhances the ability of researchers
and educators to access and use scientific data and infrastructure. These assets include
high-performance computing systems, large-scale data repositories, <em>software suites</em>, networks,
and digital access to research equipment and instrumentation <em>as well as education resources</em>.

    <title>Cyberinfrastructure in Mathematics Research</title>
    <p>
One of the features of many areas of mathematics, including the applicant's area of
general topology, is the expansive breadth of open problems that still technically require just
pencil and paper. Nonetheless, as technology advances, we are seeing more uses for
tools beyond the blackboard for making advancements in even abstract mathematics.
One obvious example is the use of high-performance (or even conventional) computing to brute-force
the exploration of finite mathematical spaces <xref ref="biblio-high-compute"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
But perhaps underrated are the systems used by mathematicians for sharing and collaborating
bleeding-edge advancements with the community of research. The mathematics written on paper
or the chalkboard cannot travel far on its own; generally, mathematicians use software such
as LaTeX to typeset proofs and formulas for distribution in PDF format. Then, rather than asking
colleagues from across the country to physically visit their office computer, the researcher uses
technologies such as email, a personal website, and/or a preprint server to post their work
for dissemination. High-quality work must then be submitted to a journal to be vetted by peers,
a process handled sometimes through email, and other times via non-trivial content management
systems hosted in the cloud. These results are then published, but this content is now burned
into inaccessible (in many senses of the word) PDFs locked behind paywalls. A typical strategy for
finding recent developments in mathematics is to Google key words, but a search for
<q>selection games</q>, an area of mathematical game theory studied by the applicant, quickly reveals
the limitations of this approach.
    </p>
    <p>
One approach to overcoming this limitation is the development of databases of mathematical
objects. As of writing, the <pubtitle>Catalogue of Mathematical Datasets</pubtitle> <xref ref="biblio-mathdb"/>
enumerates <m>83</m> such tools. One of these is the
<pubtitle><m>\pi</m>-Base</pubtitle> (a.k.a. pi-Base) community database of topological counterexamples
<xref ref="biblio-pibase"/>, created by software engineer James Dabbs. Clontz joined the project in
2017 to serve as its lead mathematical editor. In the beginning the database was treated similar to a wiki,
with unreviewed contributions made by several mathematicians, students, and other unknown contributors.
To address this, changes were made to the software to enforce a level of peer review, and Clontz was awarded
with an internal Faculty Development Council grant to hire a student to audit and expand the content of the
database.
    </p>
    <p>
The result of this support was successful, and today the pi-Base is commonly cited on mathematics
discussion boards used by students and researchers alike <xref ref="biblio-mathse-search"/>
<xref ref="biblio-mo-search"/>. However, it also exposed critical inefficiencies in the user
experience (UX) of both contributing to the database and reviewing contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
Another key element of cyberinfrastructure in mathematics research is the tooling used for
creating both collaborative spaces and venues for dissemination, both virtually and in-person.
Of course, recent events have exposed the utility of virtual collaborations, and tools such as Zoom and Sococo have
done well to meet this need both for small meetings and large conferences. But organization of
large conferences, whether in-person or otherwise, is not easily done without the use of technology.
Historically, the <pubtitle>Topology Atlas</pubtitle> <xref ref="biblio-atlas"/> met this need,
not just in topology but in many other areas of mathematics as well,
but this abstract and conference scheduling service was ended in 2020 following twenty-five years in
production. Its shuttering has left a void that creates inefficiencies for researchers,
distracting from their core work.

Logistics are frequently a limiting factor in the adoption of evidence-based practices
in instruction, particularly in undergraduate mathematics education.
