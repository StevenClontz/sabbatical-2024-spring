        <p>
NSF's Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) <q>supports and coordinates the development,
acquisition, and provision of state-of-the-art cyberinfrastructure resources, tools and services
essential to the advancement and transformation of science and engineering</q>, and the NSF has doubled-down
on this commitment with the recent establishment of its <q>Technology, Innovation and Partnerships</q> directorate,
the first new NSF directorate in over 30 years. In service of this
mission, Dr. Clontz serves as co-PI on NSF DUE Award 2011807,
responsible for the development of several technologies to support evidence-based pedagogies in
undergraduate mathematics education, and his NSF Proposal 2230153 as PI to develop an Open-Source Ecosystem
fostering technologies used in the development of STEM higher-education Open Educational Resources
has been recommended for funding beginning in 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
This proposal requests to leverage the momentum from these projects by allowing Clontz to spend Spring 2024
collaborating with scholars across the country in the development of
advanced free-and-open-source (FOSS) cyberinfrastructure for mathematics research and STEM
higher education. The American Institute of Mathematics
will serve as Clontz's host for this sabbatical leave.
The deliverables of this sabbatical will include multiple software products benefiting mathematics research
and STEM higher education, enhancement of the human infrastructure surrounding these products, and
the continued development of Clontz's ongoing research in general topology.
