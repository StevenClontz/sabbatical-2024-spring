NSF's Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) <q>supports and coordinates the development,
acquisition, and provision of state-of-the-art cyberinfrastructure resources, tools and services
essential to the advancement and transformation of science and engineering</q>. In service of this
mission, Dr. Clontz serves as co-PI on NSF DUE Award 2011807 <xref ref="biblio-tbil-award"/>,
responsible for the development of several technologies to support evidence-based pedagogies in
undergraduate mathematics
education. Likewise, Clontz previously received an internal Faculty Development Council grant to
hire a student worker to audit and expand the
<pubtitle><m>\pi</m>-Base</pubtitle> <xref ref="biblio-pibase"/> database of topological spaces
for use in mathematics research.
        </p>
        <p>
This proposal requests to leverage the momentum from these projects by allowing Clontz to spend one semester
during the 2022-23 academic year collaborating with scholars across the country in the development of
advanced free-and-open-source (FOSS) cyberinfrastructure for mathematics research and undergraduate
mathematics education. The American Institute of Mathematics <xref ref="biblio-aim"/>
will serve as Clontz's host for this sabbatical leave, and his collaborators will include steering committee
chairs of two major topology research conferences, as well as a professional software engineer with a background
in topology. In addition to software deliverables that will enhance mathematics research and education,
this leave will be used to develop proposals for additional external funding from the National Science
Foundation, produce traditional academic research in topology to be
presented at conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals, and
network with statewide magnet STEM high schools to promote the University to high-performing students.
